# PlotPatch

PlotPatch is an innovative web application designed to generate creative contents for stories with the support of Gemini from Google AI. This tool is perfect for writers, readers, and fans of fiction, allowing them to engage in conversations with characters from various narratives or their own creative stories, explore more community activities, and find out similar work that might be of interests. PlotPatch aims to mitigate the feelings of "blue" or "emptiness" after stories, making it a perfect tool for story lovers.

## Features

- **Fan Fiction Generator**: "Write" your own fan fiction stories! Instead of looking for fan fictions written by others, you can generate your own stories and determine the characters you want to see, their roles and relationships. You can also decide the story background, outlines, and more details.
- **Character Bot**: Input and define roles for characters to shape the conversation context. Engage in real-time dialogue with a variety of characters, just like chatting with friends!
- **Community Space**: Explore more community activities! Find social media groups and community activities to enjoy discussions and events with fans who love the same stories.
- **Criteria-based Recommendation**: Find more similar work to the ones you like based on your own criteria. You might like a work because of its writing style, themes, messages, or nuances like how a scene is set up. You can find work with similar components with the powerful support from Gemini.
